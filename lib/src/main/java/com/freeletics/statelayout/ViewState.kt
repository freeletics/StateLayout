/**
 * Describes a view state that can be rendered by [StateLayout].
 *
 * [onCreateView] is responsible for inflating/constructing the [View] that should be shown when the
 * [ViewState] is displayed. [onBindView] should be used to bind any dynamic data to the [View]. The reason for this
 * separation is that [View]s can be reused between multiple [ViewState]s:
 * If two [ViewState]s share the same [id], [onCreateView] will only be called when the first [ViewState] is shown. For
 * the second one, the same [View] is reused and only attached to the new [ViewState] by calling [onBindView]. This
 * mechanism works similar to the one used in [RecyclerView.Adapter]s.
 *
 * A common use case for view re-usage is e.g. to define different error states (generic error, network error, etc)
 * that all share the same layout. When switching between these, the layout will only be inflated once and each
 * [ViewState] will just bind different data to it (e.g. set a different error message).
 *
 * An easy way to create a new [ViewState] is to use the convenient factory [ViewState.create]. It will simply inflate
 * its [View] from a given layout resource id.
 *
 * See [StateLayout] for some example usages.
 *
